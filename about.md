Kaixo!, I’m David. I’m a software engineer living in Madrid, España. Obsessed with making my own tiny contribution to this world, but doing it with a reason.

### Professional Career

Since some years, I have set myself goals such as creating new projects, go in-depth in the spirit of the entrepreneur and be in constant development. For now I have a lot to learn, and I hope that it will always continue; while I am trying to get these goals I work as BackEnd Developer in Indexa Capital, in which I learn from the bests. In the little free time I have left, I like to explore the exciting world of AI (master in machine learning) that I hope will help me to achieve the goal of creating new projects that make a significant change, but they must have a reason and not just an economic purpose.

Respect Software philosophy since I met the world DDD I am totally in love with him, of course without forgetting my lovers as Solid-principles, agile development and clean code. In my I.T. career, I have a couple of projects which I am really proud: I developed an Android app for an ERP (Update), customization and total management of a dating and web application from Dating (Mondia) and the work that I currently do for Indexa (Our feedback of 9 in Trustpilot is the true metric that we do really well).

If you are interested in talking to me, you can do it on Twitter ([@cerezal_david](https://twitter.com/cerezal_david)) or Email ([david.cerezal77@gmail.com](mailto:david.cerezal77@gmail.com)), I do not usually take more than a day to close the ticket.

### Hobbies

The technology offers me a vast range of opportunities and options that fascinates me, for that reason I work in that area and spend the majority of my life also there. But I also have some life beyond, and some hobbie.

I love wood-crafting, nature and mountains, plants and bonsais; history and philosophy, and all related literature, visit my beloved Basque Country, photography and especially eat salmorejo and tortilla de patatas (such a good "patatero" from Vitoria, of course); Walk through Madrid, modeling, my town of Cea and all its history ..... But most of these have no place in this blog, although I will try to write about most of them.

Also in these recent years I am entering the world of [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/158256218@N06/), for now I'm newbie but I hope to improve, and buy a camera ;)
