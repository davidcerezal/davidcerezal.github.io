Kaixo!, I’m David. I’m a software engineer living in Madrid, España.Obsessed with making my own tiny contribution to this world, but doing it with a reason.

Puedes ver un poco de mi twitter:

Since some years, I have set myself goals such as creating new projects, go in-depth in the spirit of the entrepreneur and be in constant development. For now I have a lot to learn, and I hope that it will always continue; while I am trying to get these goals I work as BackEnd Developer in Indexa Capital, in which I learn from the bests. In the little free time I have left, I like to explore the exciting world of AI (deep-learning) that I hope will help me to achieve the goal of creating new projects that make a significant change, but they must have a reason and not just an economic purpose.

Respect Software philosophy since I met the world DDD I am totally in love with him, of course without forgetting my lovers as Solid-principles, agile development and clean code.

In my I.T. career, I have a couple of projects which I am really proud: I developed an Android app for an ERP (Update), customization and total management of a dating and web application from Dating (Mondia) and the work that I do in Indexa (Our feedback of 9 in Trustpilot is the true metric that we do really well).

If you are interested in talking to me, you can do it on Twitter (@cerezal_david) or Email (david.cerezal77@gmail.com), I do not usually take more than a day to close the ticket.
